    "intro": "The Mann-Kendall trend test is a statistical method used to assess if there is a significant trend (upward or downward) in a time series or data set. It is based on the ranks of data points, making it a non-parametric test, and it is widely used in various fields to detect trends in environmental, climatic, and economic data, among others. Since the data consists of strictly monthly data, the seasonal Mann-Kendall test is used for the MK calculation (Hirsch, R.M., Slack, J.R. and Smith, R.A. (1982) \n\nThe Sen test works similarly in that it is a non-parametric statistical test used to detect trends in time series or data sets. It estimates the slope of the trend by calculating the median of all possible pairwise slopes between data points, making it robust to outliers and more suitable for skewed or irregularly distributed data.\n\nThe Linear regression allows an additional visual control for the decision, if a detected upward or downward trend is indeed confirmed by the data.",
